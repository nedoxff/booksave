# `booksave`

booksave is a simple extension that lets you export your twitter bookmarks, liked tweets and even your own media.

![a demo of the extension](https://github.com/nedoxff/booksave/blob/main/demo.gif)

# why?

- if you're moving to bluesky (god bless), you might want to preserve the thousands of bookmarks you (might have) accumulated over the years of using twitter.
- this extension runs completely locally, without the need of any external resources (except twitter), which makes it basically free-to-operate and thus free-to-use.
- why not?

# where can i find it?

right now, nowhere. i've never published an extension before, so this might take a while to publish.

# how?

a mix of semi-secret twitter APIs and lack of sleep :)
