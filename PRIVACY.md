# privacy policy

in the chrome extension store, it is listed that this extension collects authorization data. that is true, however **it is not sent anywhere** and is only used to access twitter's API. 

specifically, the extension reads the following cookies for `x.com`:

- `auth_token` (authorization token)
- `ct0` (security token, necessary to make requests)
- `twid` (stores the user ID)

**i do not have the intention of stealing accounts.** booksave is open-source software, so you can check the source code if you have suspicions.

by using the extension, you agree that:

- you have read this privacy policy.
- you understand that your data isn't used in any malicious ways.
- in case of any misunderstandings, you have the right to create [an issue](https://github.com/nedoxff/booksave/issues) or contact me directly.
